Q86::The Scissor truss holds the highest force, and thus gets closest to failure. While not very close, it is the closest. The 6 Panel Pratt has the lowest normal stress, and also uses less material because it is less complex. I personally like the aesthetic of the triangular trusses more than the scissor truss. The scissor truss has the most zero force members along its length. 
Q87::I would personally recommend the Modified Gabled Pratt truss for this project. It distributes the load most evenly, giving the lowest normal stress. It also combines the aesthetics that I personally like with the functionality needed to keep the building roof from caving. Given the fact that it also has less panels, it will likely cost less to construct, and will save you money on the project. My second choice would be the Gabled Howe, it has very similar value to the Pratt, but just uses more material. I'm not a fan of the scissor truss, but that is mostly because I don't like the look, it will also do the job well, though it has the highest maximum normal stress.
